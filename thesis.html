            <p>
              Here, I offer a brief overview of my thesis, Dynamic Mode Decomposition and Network Evolution, as part of the Applied Mathematics MS at San Diego State University.
              The full thesis can be found on my <a href="https://github.com/RCSimpson/Thesis">github</a>. My thesis is studies local changes in 
              large, complex networks by using the data-driven methods: the Dynamic Mode Decomposition and Kernel Dynamic Mode Decomposition. We extract the DMD and KDMD modes,
              which contain information regarding the dynamics of the system and find that overall the resulting modes are of low mode error and reconstruct the data moderately well.
              Here, I offer a small synopsis of the networks I study and the Dynamic Mode Decomposition. 
            </p>
    
            <h3 style="font-weight: bolder;">Graph Motifs</h3>
            <p>
              We're primarily interested in the dynamics of sub-patterns in networks over time. We calls these patterns motifs. 
            </p>
            <div class="def" text='Motif'> <p> Let \( G\) be graph and \(G''\) be an induced subgraph. If \(G''\) is isomorphic to \(G'\),
              then we call \(G''\) and appearance of \(G'\). Given \(G'\) has some \(N \gg 0\) appearances, we call \(G'\) a motif. 
            </div>
            <p>
              We are essentially interested in how often these structures appear in the network and wish to see how the this local structure changes given the 
              addition of nodes and edges to a graph. We generate motif counts from the Barabasi-Albert model and the Thij Twitter model. Below is an example of some of the 
              motifs we count.

            <h3 style="font-weight:bolder;">A Short Introduction to the Koopman Operator and DMD</h3>
            <h4 style="font-weight: bold;">The Koopman Operator</h4>
            <p> The Dynamic Mode Decomposition (DMD) offers a way to extract spatio-temporal structures from data sampled from a dynamical system. DMD is theoretically
                underpinned by Koopman operator theory. This connection is weak with the standard DMD method, but can be strengthened by using variants of the DMD algorithm. 
                We begin by defining the Koopman Operator \(K\).
            </p> 
    
            <!-- <div class="def" text='The Koopman Operator'> <p> We define the Hilbert space of observables \(L_2(O) = L_2(\mathbb{R}^N,\mathbb{R}, \mu)\)
                with an associated norm \( \int_{\mathbb{R}} |g(x)|^2 dx\), and an appropiately chosen measure \(\mu\). The Koopman Operator \( K: L_2(O) \rightarrow L_2(O)\)
                is a mapping between the Hilbert space unto itself, such that
                $$
                    K(g(x_i)) = g(x_{i+1}) = g(F(x_i)), \quad g(x) \in L_2(O)
                $$
                where \(F: \mathcal{M} \rightarrow \mathcal{M}\) is a mapping on a smooth n-dimensional manifold.
            </div> -->
    
            <p>In the case where \(F\) is a discrete non-linear time-flow map, the Koopman operator advances us forward 
                one step in time. The Koopman operator is linear, but infinite-dimensional. It acts on all possible observable functions \(g(x)\). Thus we can effectively exchange a non-linear, finite-dimensional 
                dynamical system for a linear, infinite-dimensional dynamical system. As the operator is linear, it has associated eigenfunctions \(\varphi(x)\) and eigenvalues \(\lambda\). We can write 
                any observable as a linear combination of those eigenfunctions.
                    $$
                        g(x) = \sum^{\infty}_{k=1} \varphi_k(x)\xi_k
                    $$
                \(\xi_k\) is the Koopman mode associated with the \(k\)th eigenfunction. Now, as eigenfunctions are defined to satisfy \( K\varphi_k(x) = \lambda_k \varphi(x)\), we can advance foward in time like so:
                $$
                g(x_{i+1})=K(g(x_i)) = \sum^{\infty}_{k=1} \lambda_k \varphi_k(x_i)\xi_k
                $$
    
                Advancing forward in time through the non-linear flow map is now a multiplication problem. The infinite-dimensionality still poses a problem. However, maybe a only a handful of eigen-tuples describe
                most of the dynamics and we could find a reasonable approximation. To this end, we introduce DMD.
            </p>
            <h4 style="font-weight: bold;">The Dynamic Mode Decomposition</h4>
            <p>We have a matrix of snapshots from the time-series of interest:
    
              $$
              X = [x_1,x_2,\dots,x_n]
              $$
              
              Let \(g(x_k)\) be a finite dictionary of observables formed from the state space. 
              We introduce the operator \(A\):
              
              $$
              A g = A g(x_k) = g(x_{k+1}),
              $$
              
              \(A\) advances measurements along the flow \(F\) by \(\Delta t\). Beginning with our data snapshot matrix composed of the relevant observables, we write
              
              $$
              G = [g(x_0), g(x_1), g(x_2), \dots ,g(x_n)] = [g_1,g_2,\dots, g_n],
              $$
              
              which we can then break into two matrices:
              
              \begin{align*}
                  & G_+ = [g_1, g_2, g_3, \dots g_n]\\
                  & G_- = [g_0, g_1, g_2, \dots g_{n-1}]\\
              \end{align*}
              
              The matrix \(G_+\) is the matrix \(G_-\) taken forward one step in time. 
              The matrix \(A\) above relates the two matrices.
              
              $$
              G_+ = AG_-
              $$
              
              Finding \(A\) means solving the optimization problem
              
              $$
              \|G_+ - {A}G_- \|_{F}
              $$
              
              where \(\| \cdot \|_{F}\) denotes the Frobenius norm. The 
              solution to the optimization problem is found using the Moore-Penrose psuedoinverse.
              
              $$
              A = G_+ G^{\dagger}_{-} ,
              $$
              We compute the r-rank Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) and generate a low-rank approximation
              of the matrix \(A\) which we shall call \({\tilde A}\). 
    
                \begin{align*}
                    G_+ &= {\tilde A}G_- \\
                    &= {\tilde A}U_rS_rV_r \quad \text{by SVD} \\ 
                G_+ V^{*}_r S^{-1}_r U^{*}_r &= {\tilde A} \\
                \end{align*}
    
              \(U^{*}_r\) and \(V^{*}_r\) are the conjugate transposes of the matrices \(U_r\) and \(V_r\). An eigendecomposition on the left-hand side results in the 
              DMD modes \(\xi_j\) and eigenvalues \(\mu_j\). The DMD modes represent spatio-temporal structures. Their eigenvalues represent their associated temporal behavior. 
              The approximated eigenfunctions can be found by solving the linear-algebra problem:
              $$
              G = \Xi \Phi
              $$
              where the columns of \(\Xi\) contain the DMD modes. 
            </p>
            <h3>A Few Select Results</h3>
            <p> 
              We applied the DMD algorithm to time-series produced by the Barabasi-Albert and the Thij model networks. Here are examples of the DMD modes, eigenvalues, and approximated eigenfunctions.
              The top subplot shows the associated eigenvalues. The columns of the second subplot represent the individual modes, showing a temporal relationship between motifs. The last
              subplot in the bottom row, shows the approximated eigenfunction values (phi modes) over time, or how much each DMD mode contributes to the dynamics. Directly below, 
              we have the DMD results for a Barabasi-Albert simulation.
